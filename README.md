# turing_words
i created this different kind of word to provide the tool for the people to have a place to decode and transfer their data.
basically they have two ways to track and block the messages. 
One is to search words in the html coding table. if you got the sensitive words, they will detect the website, 
delete your website or monitor your messages.

Another one is using the features and ANN to monitor the pictures and voice messages.
If they detect the similar features of sensitive voice 
or pictures they will monitor your messages too. 

So i created the turing words. In html, the detection will show a bunch of '1' and space. Of cource we can replace any other signal with 1.
it is like hieroglyph in Egypt. The reason is that 
for example: we use the "1" to create the alphabet like the "e" below: (but some letters are really not good looking such as 'a')

    e = ["  111 ",
         " 1   1",
         " 11111",
         " 1    ",
         "  1111"]

    g = ["  111",
         " 1  1",
         "  111",
         "    1",
         "  111"]

         


Of course, this turing word is not that good looking. and I also need to set a format that can create the turing word in a specific
length and width. but in the different languages such as Chinese and Janpanese, it is hard to create it with just 1 or 0. 
Maybe I can solve the problems in the future. And I also do really appreciate that people can help me  improve this turing word.

the reason is that we do believe that people have privacy and privilege to speak.
